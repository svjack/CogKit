  model_type: "t2v"                # Model type (text-to-video)
  training_type: "lora"            # Training type

# Output Configuration
output:
  output_dir: "/path/to/output"    # Directory to save outputs
  report_to: "tensorboard"         # Logging framework

# Data Configuration
data:
  data_root: "/path/to/data"       # Path to training data

# Training Configuration
training:
  seed: 42                         # Random seed for reproducibility
  train_epochs: 1                  # Number of training epochs
